# Fraud Detection
Developed a decision tree model using Python with SQL integration to identify key factors and predict fraudulent CD accounts, achieving an AUC score (accuracy) of 0.878; Built an Excel dashboard connected to SQL database to display key metrics like fraud rate and top predictors dynamically

The project answers:
1.	Is credit score predictive of fraud or not? 
2.	What's the top 5 predictors of fraud?
3.	A score distribution 
4.	Accuracy, precision and recall of the model at a predicted probability of fraud of 0.5 and above

Methodologies used:
1. Exploratory analysis
2. Decision tree model
