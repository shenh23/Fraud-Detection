# Fraud Detection
Built a decision tree model and visualization using Python, SQL, and Excel to identify metrics with the most predicting power and to detect potential fraudulent accounts, reaching an accuracy of 89% and recall of 63%

The project answers:
1.	Is credit score predictive of fraud or not? 
2.	What's the top 5 predictors of fraud?
3.	A score distribution 
4.	Accuracy, precision and recall of the model at a predicted probability of fraud of 0.5 and above

Methodologies used:
1. Exploratory analysis
2. Decision tree model
